          Well initially I started in retail/restaurant management and spent
          over 10 years gaining valuable experience and skills from that. I
          transitioned into a contractual roll installing commercial LED
          technology. During that time I also focused on brand enhancement for
          small businesses. That included logo design, restaurant menu graphics,
          Product placement and photography.{" "}
